## What are embeddings?

Embeddings capture the “relatedness” of text, images, video, or other types of information. This relatedness is most commonly used for:
- Search: how similar is a search term to a body of text?
- Recommendations: how similar are two products?
- Classifications: how do we categorize a body of text?
- Clustering: how do we identify trends?
